# Elm Web Components Playground
## From [DailyDrip](https://www.dailydrip.com)

This is an example application for exploring [Elm](http://www.elm-lang.org) and
[Web Components](http://webcomponents.org/) together, specifically using
[Polymer components](https://elements.polymer-project.org/).

I've created [an introductory walkthrough video / blog post for pairing the
two](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm/drips/web-components-introduction),
if you'd like to check it out.

You can [try out a demo here](https://knewter.github.io/elm_web_components_playground/).
